This scenario explains the classification of handwritten digits using **TensorFlow**.

We will learn the steps, how to download the dataset, visualize image, train a classifier, evaluate,  visualize the weights, etc.

The environment has a Docker installation configured, running on a host called `docker`. Everything else required we'll launch as containers and we will access the `Jupyter` Notebook in the browser and complete the tutorial.
