In this tutorial on Docker storage, we learn:

How docker images are stored locally by the Docker engine.
How the copy-on-write mechanism and the union file system optimize storage and start up time for Docker containers.
The variety of storage drivers compatible with Docker.
How volumes provide shared persistent data for Docker containers.
With this you can think of mounting a volume and attach deattach to and from the container and safely store your data.
